                <h2><span class="number">01.</span>Overview</h2>
                <p>As the <b>Public Relations Officer</b>, I have started designing a visual identity and content system for the upcoming year of DCU Orchestra. These materials will be used on Instagram, Linkedin and in physical promotions starting in the new semester.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2><span class="number">02.</span>Goals</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Grow awareness and visibility of the society.</li>
                    <br><li>Create an inviting and notable online presence.</li>
                    <br><li>Make it easy for people to join and engage with us.</li>

                <h2><span class="number">03.</span>Branding System</h2>
                <div class="image-grid-2">
                    <img src="img/dcuo-brand-style-guide-1.png">
                    <img src="img/dcuo-brand-style-guide-2.png">
                </div>
                <ol>
                    <li>For the main colours of DCU Orchestra's designs, I chose cobalt blue and gold to reflect the orchestra’s mix of tradition and energy; blue for structure and unity, and gold for creativity and excitement. The high contrast also makes the design stand out and ties in with DCU’s own colour scheme.</li>
                    <br><li>I created a logo system that blends musical identity with university pride. The crotchet note replacing the “d” in DCU Orchestra visually anchors the group in music, while the use of all lowercase gives it a friendly, modern tone. Simplified versions ensure the identity stays clear and consistent across print, digital, and small-scale use.</li>
                    <br><li>For typography, I combined Lora (a classic serif) with Poppins (a modern sans-serif) to balance the formal feel of an orchestra with the fresh, student-led nature of the society.</li>
                    <br><li>The Instagram highlight covers gradually shift into a deeper blue to visually represent the society’s growth. </li>
                    <br><li>On each carousel post, the swipe icon includes our submark logo, so the brand stays recognisable as people scroll through our content.</li>
                    <br><li>Lists are contained by corner designs made up of musical notes which further highlights the orchestra's focus.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2><span class="number">04.</span>Social Media Strategy</h2>
                <p>I planned a flexible content strategy to keep the DCU Orchestra’s Instagram active and inviting for both new and returning members.</p>
                <h3>Types of content</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Info posts</li>
                    <br><li>Announcements</li>
                    <br><li>Engagement posts (polls, member spotlights, etc)</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Colour coded system</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Blue for announcements</li>
                    <br><li>White for informational posts</li>
                    <br><li>Gold for engagement posts</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I chose blue backgrounds with yellow and white text for announcement posts because this color combination closely matches the DCU logo. I want people to immediately think of the college when they see our posts, and hopefully, for our orchestra to become strongly associated with DCU in the future.</p>
                <p>I make our informational posts have a white background so they catch people’s attention clearly and feel clean and easy to read. The white space helps the text and details stand out, making important info simple to find and understand.</p>
                <h3>Tone</h3>
                <p>Approachable, welcoming and enthusiastic to match the orchestra’s personality.</p>
                <h3>Reusable templates</h3>
                <p>I created reusable templates to simplify posting throughout the year and maintain a consistent brand look. This makes it easier to keep the feed active and on-brand without needing to redesign every time.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I designed promotional posters, stickers, and bookmarks featuring a custom QR code that links directly to the membership page.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>QR codes make it easier for people to join without needing to type a full link, especially in busy settings like campus.</li>
                    <br><li>Stickers were chosen because they can be placed anywhere (on laptops, notebooks, instrument cases etc), turning everyday items into passive promo.</li>
                    <br><li> Bookmarks are useful for students and easy to keep in notebooks or bring to class, helping the orchestra stay on their minds even after the fair.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="important">The bookmark design features a music staff with full notes on D and C, representing DCU. Since a 'U' note doesn't exist, I replaced it with a quarter rest; a short pause that represents an inviting moment where <b>YOU</b> could literally complete the <b>REST</b> by joining the orchestra. <b>This graphic shows that in music, every pause is just a brief moment before we all come together again.</b>

                <p>I also made table toppers and banners for our stand (a similar version of one of the banners is also on our Linkedin page).</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The phone graphic was used to subtly reinforce our online presence.</li>
                    <br><li>The envelope design was chosen to emphasise that we're inviting people to the orchestra.</li>
                    <br><li>The banners show “DCU ORCHESTRA” in all caps, matching our social media style, with the favicon next to it to help people recognise us even in small spaces.
